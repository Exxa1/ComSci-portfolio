Creating this space allowed me to learn about up-to-date tools for website making. The website is built using the Vite build tool, and node.js for the backend. Since previously I built frontend using plain HTML, CSS, and Js, this project had a steep learning curve. It gave me insights into what is possible with modern tools and I learned a lot about how to work with javascript frameworks.</p>"
