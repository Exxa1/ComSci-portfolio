    "content": "<h2>Abstract</h2><p>This report investigates how excess entropy scaling affects transport coefficients for ternary (threecomponent) supercooled mixtures, building upon previous studies which have been conducted for large systems of supercooled single-component and binary mixtures. The results indicate quasiuniversal excess entropy scaling across different temperatures for a given mixture, a collapse which continues to hold across the two compositions of the KA mixture, KA 8:2:2 and KA 8:2:4; as well as across two different models, the KA model and the WS model. This quasi-universality appears to operate in a similar, but not equivalent manner to the correlation found for binary mixtures in a previous study. More research is required to delve into how excess entropy scaling works, and how multi-component supercooled systems can take advantage of this functionality. <br> <a href='src/assets/PDFs/excess_entropy_scaling_aronkuna.pdf' download='entropyscaling'>Clink here to download the research paper</a></p>"
