Most of the programming is done in Vue and Js. The front-end is developed using Tailwind CSS. The website is hosted on Netlify, utilizing the company's serverless function option. The whole project is version-controlled using Git and GitHub. </br> </br> The whole project is made from scratch. Developing the website gave me useful insights into how to utilize modules in NUXT and what a powerful framework it is.</p>"
